This test data `ercc.txt` was the ERCC spike-in expression counts download from URL: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-2805/. It contains the expression counts of 92 spike-in RNAs across 288 cells, which belong to three subgroups based on their cell cycle states.
The label file `ercc.label.txt` contains the cell cycle states (G1, G2M, and S) of all cells with the same order in `ercc.txt`. One column, one label per row and no header.
